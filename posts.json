Among the 8 'awesome' hours of RWD gold, Brad introduced us to <a href=http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/link/atomic-design/ target=_blank>Atomic Design</a>, a modular approach to responsive design and development, and his brand new tool <a href=http://patternlab.bradfrostweb.com/ target=_blank>Pattern Lab</a> for forging websites using the Atomic Design approach.</p><p>One of the other topics during the day was inevitably the art of selecting breakpoints, and more importantly for this post, the naming of the SASS variables for these breakpoints, and how said names could be tied into Atomic Design.</p>"}]}
