title: 'When did we stop trying?'
---
It seems to me that during the last few weeks that more and more of us are giving up. Everywhere I point my eyes, and everywhere I turn my ears there's someone, somewhere, saying something like; <q>Framework this. Framework that. No one disables JavaScript. When can I stop supporting IE some version of other?</q> It's now so common I find myself asking when did we stop trying?
