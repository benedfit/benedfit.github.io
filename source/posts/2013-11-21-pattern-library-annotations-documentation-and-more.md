What started out as a simple chat this afternoon between myself and [Cheryl Natel](https://twitter.com/cheryl_lis) on the ways in which we could integrate functional specifications into pattern libraries spawned into a great discussion on the topic via an impromptu Google Hangout.

Thanks to [Dave Rupert](https://twitter.com/davatron5000), [Brad Frost](https://twitter.com/brad_frost), [Geoff Barnes](https://twitter.com/texburgher), [Aaron Gustafson](https://twitter.com/AaronGustafson) and [Patrick Fulton](https://twitter.com/patrickfulton) for coming online and sharing how they do it. And apologies to all of you that I didn't make into the Hangout, but a two prong attack from a failed internet connection and a sick child had me beat!
